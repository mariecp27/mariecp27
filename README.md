## Hi there! I'm Maria Herlandia ðŸ‘‹

I am a bilingual chemical engineer, a software developer technician, and a full-stack web development student. I have knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript; furthermore, I have completed some personal projects by using PHP for connecting with Relational Databases, SQL.

I am a creative person, goal oriented, and I am willing to learn new things ðŸ˜„.

ðŸ“–  Since December 2021 I belong to the Full-stack Web Development Bootcamp offered by ProTalento, where the technical aspect is in charge of Digital House. Along with my teamwork, we are working in order to ensure that the bootcamp project, an e-commerce, full fit all requirements, and that it allows us to gain experience in additional features.

Finally, in February 2022 I started working as a Product Owner in the applications department in WebHelp, Medellin.

ðŸ’» I am looking for opportunities for starting a career as a developer.
